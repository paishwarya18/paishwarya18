<h3>Markup</h3>
    <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
    
    Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>
     
<h4>Elements</h4>
<p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets</p></br>
<div>Attributes</div>
 <p>Most of the attributes of an element are name-value pairs, separated by = and written within the start tag of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML). Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe.In contrast with name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element simply by their presence in the start tag of the element like the ismap attribute for the img element.</p>
   <h5>Character and entity references</h5></br>
   <p>As of version 4.0, HTML defines a set of 252 character entity references and a set of 1,114,050 numeric character references, both of which allow individual characters to be written via simple markup, rather than literally. A literal character and its markup counterpart are considered equivalent and are rendered identically.</p>

<div>Data types</div>
    <p> HTML defines several data types for element content, such as script data and stylesheet data, and a plethora of types for attribute values, including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, media descriptors, colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on. All of these data types are specializations of character data.</p>
    
   <h6>Document type declaration</h6> 
   <p> HTML documents are required to start with a Document Type Declaration (informally, a "doctype"). In browsers, the doctype helps to define the rendering modeâ€”particularly whether to use quirks mode.</p>

<div>Semantic HTML</div>
<p> HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation (look). HTML has included semantic markup from its inception, but has also included presentational markup, such as <font>, <i></i> and <center></center> tags. There are also the semantically neutral span and div tags. Since the late 1990s, when Cascading Style Sheets were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the separation of presentation and content.</p>

<div>Delivery</div>
    <p>
        HTML documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file. However, they are most often delivered either by HTTP from a web server or by email.</p>
